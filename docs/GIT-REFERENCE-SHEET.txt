::::WORKING WITH BRANCHES::::

LIST BRANCHES:
git branch

CREATE A NEW BRANCH:
git checkout -b mynewbranch

Comment: 
this will create a new branch based of the branch that you
currently use. If you wanna base a branch of another specific branch you
issue this command:

git checkout mynewbranch masterbranch

OR IF YOU WANNA WORK ON A SPECIFIC VERSION NUMBER (A TAG):
git checkout -b mynewbranch 6.2

..or..

git checkout mynewbranch master 6.2

Comment: They mean almost the same, except that the last one specifies what branch name
you wanna base your work off. Where as the first one will base off what branch you 
currently are in - again, issue: 
git branch
to list your current active branch

SWITCH BETWEEN BRANCHES:
git checkout mynewbranch
..and back to master..
git checkout master

MERGE MYNEWBRANCH WITH MASTER:
git merge mynewbranch

REMEMBER YOU CAN AT ANYTIME CHECK STATUS QUO ON YOUR BRANCH BY ISSUING:
git status
