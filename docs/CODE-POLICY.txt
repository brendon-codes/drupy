********* static ********
example:

Drupal: static names
Drupy: global static_menugetnames_names

skeleton policy: static_FUNCTION-NAME_VARIABLE-NAME

******  end static *******

******* array ********
example:

Drupal: names = array()
Drupy: names = []

Comments: a PHP array becomes a mutable python list

****** end array ******

****** while loop w/arimetric operation [EXPERIMENTAL] ********

Drupal: while ($level-- > 0 && $tree){

Drupy: for level in range(100, 1, -1): 
         if not tree: 
         break

Wrong Drupy: while (level -= 1 > 0 and tree):

Comments: as you can see, one can not perform a expression within the condition area with python.
So in this case we turn it into a for loop that performs the decrementation and give the tree 
variable a if not clause.

****** END while loop w/arimetric operation ********
