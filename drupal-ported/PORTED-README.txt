Anytime a file is ported from Drupal CVS HEAD to Drupy, a copy of file should
be stored in this directory "drupal-ported". This provides an easy way to track changes
with newer CVS revisions.

Please do not copy a file into drupal-ported until the port is 100% complete. Also, remember
to preserve original file structure.
