General comments: 
- I've not commented on all the bracelets that I removed. They are many(!) :)
- Solving one of this issues will provide a solution to many. As they are the same. 
- these comments will maybe provide a pattern match for that can be inclueded in the conversion script.
- The reason for commenting out the all these code, is so we can discuss together how we attack the issues. Not solving them differently. This is to avoid inconsitency.
- I purpose a "Ugly hacks list" that lists the code that contains ugly hacks. This way we can revisit the issues, by tagging them as outstanding issues. And see if anyone else with more python skills can solve them in a more dear I say graceful manner. Not that I've encountered any, or committed any.
*********************************************
GENERAL ISSUES:
1. Make sure all REF_ variables are converted 
to use REF_ inside the functions as well.
2. There is a function in php named array_pop, that maybe does the same
as dict.pop in python.

line 291 is commented out due mysql query
line 292-299 mysql query
line 297 has set return declared as a variable. This is not possible with python
line 384 has a variable named return. It's renamed to returned
line 389 has return as variable, and I renamed it to returned
line 409 has a ternary that is commented out due to invalid syntax
line 412 is commented out due to some weird syntax (bool)callback ...??
line 413 added print "this string needs to be removed"
line 419 commented out due to invalid syntax for user_access(arguments[0], arguments[1]) in the ternary
line 420 added print "this string needs to be removed"
line 449 removed reference sign & for variable item
line 511 removed reference sign & for variable router
line 524 for loop got ported
line 547 removed & sign from  reference variable map
line 644 needs a closer review(!).. I may have done weird things here. I've commented out the entire function.
line 661 is defining a static variable... And I commented it out, due to invalid syntax. See issue below.

*** START ISSUE ***
line 682 items[] = data;  How do I port this one? items being a array. Which means we have to use dict? I'm commenting out this one for now. Added a print "this string needs to be removed"
*** END ISSUE  *** 

line 701 return value depends on a ternary. I don't know how to construct this. Is it even possible with python? I commented it out, and I did a 'return output' only..
line 719 same as line 661. A static variable. Commented out.
line 722 the ternary construct is not sane. Invalid syntax. Commented out.
line 744 ported for loop. for var1 in range(var2, <indexstart>, <increment/decrement-interval>)
line 745 is commented out. Don't know how to port it..replaced with print "this string needs to be removed"
line 751 is commented out. Don't know how to port it..
line 764-767 is commmented out due to db query.
line 801 is commented out, due to static command set to be a array.. Invalid syntax.
line 805 (int)item['access']  how do i port this one? I get an invalid syntax. I had to comment out this line.
line 847 changed = to == in while loop.
line 852 do..while(num_rows) ends here. Starts at line 844. Commented out. 
line 865-869 contains this sql query that gives us a syntax error. Commented out.
line 922 replaced the = operator with ==
line 924 foreach loop got ported. But not very well. So this needs more investigation. See originale file (menu.inc)
line 968 throws away the first item returned(before the comma, in the arguments). But it does not work in python. So we need a solution to this. It's commented out for now.
line 981 replaced = operator with == in while loop
line 991-992 contains the : syntax. The dict seems broken? Commenting it out for now.
line 1010 contains the : syntax. The dict seems broken... Commenting it out for now.
line 1058 class variable is assigned this nested ternary construct. Don't know if this can be achieved with python. Commenting it out for now. Added print "this string needs to be removed"
line 1109 static names got commented out, I don't know yet how to port this one.
line 1201-1318 removed entire function named menu_local_tasks() - we need to be carefull when porting this one
line 2267 commented out --> require_once drupal_get_path('module', 'user') + '/user.pages.inc' 
line 647 this line _needs_ a closer review,
																		 Drupal:	isset(router_item['load_functions']position) 
																		 Drupy:   isset(router_item['load_functions'],position)
line 975 this line also needs a closer review,
																		 Drupal:	list(, tree) = _menu_tree_data(result, parents, depth) 
																		 Drupy:   became list = _menu_tree_data(result, parents, depth)
