GENERAL ISSUES:
1. There is a function in php named array_pop, that maybe does the same
as dict.pop in python.
2. Review all foreach loops.
3. There are several custom functions like isset() and empty(), but also is_array() - are they all consistent
   with how index key are set?
*********************************************
line 927 foreach loop got ported. But not very well? So this needs more investigation. See originale file (menu.inc)

line 2267 commented out --> require_once drupal_get_path('module', 'user') + '/user.pages.inc'
