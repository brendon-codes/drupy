GENERAL ISSUES:
1. There is a function in php named array_pop, that maybe does the same
as dict.pop in python.

line 292-299 mysql query

line 744 ported for loop. for var1 in range(var2, <indexstart>, <increment/decrement-interval>)

line 857 do..while(num_rows) ends here. Starts at line 852. This one needs a closer review. Compare it with menu.inc and make sure we get the same result as in the drupal version.

line 927 foreach loop got ported. But not very well? So this needs more investigation. See originale file (menu.inc)

line 2267 commented out --> require_once drupal_get_path('module', 'user') + '/user.pages.inc' 

isset( object|list|dict, property|index|key )

line 975:
																		 Drupal:	list(, tree) = _menu_tree_data(result, parents, depth)
																		 Drupy:   tree = _menu_tree_data(result, parents, depth)[1]
																			
													Comments: list(, tree) throws away the first item returned(before the comma, in the arguments)
