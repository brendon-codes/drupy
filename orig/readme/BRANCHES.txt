IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE!
-----------------------
When cloning drupy, always do a:

  gitignore base/sites/default/setting.py

(you do not want to commit your mysql password and username)



NOTE: Drupy uses GIT now.
      THIS IDEA IS NOW SOMEWHAT IMPLEMENTED.


BRANCH STRUCTURE
----------------
Solving porting issues with branches.

Today I got this excellent idea, or I should say a solution to this problem I've been pondering.
Primarily I want drupy to be a so much straight port of drupal to python as possible.
However, sooner or later we have to make changes to drupy that is not present in drupal. For instance,
we are gonna add Object Oriented capabilities to drupy by adding class declarations. This will clearly distance drupy
from drupal. And this list of differences will most problably continue to grow as the project matures.
*************************************************************************************************************
Here is what I purpose:

Branch #1: A straight and clean port of drupal to python.

Branch #2: The straight port of drupal to python + all the custom stuff we want.

With Branch #1 we just continue to port commits from Drupal HEAD branch. 
Then we merge the changes from Branch #1 into Branch #2. Where Branch #2 is the main drupy branch.
With Branch #1 it will be easy to port changes, and track history, and possible revert something if we experience a shit.hits.the.fan situation.
