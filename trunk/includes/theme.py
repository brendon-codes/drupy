#
# Generate the themed output.
#
# All requests for theme hooks must go through this function. It examines
# the request and routes it to the appropriate theme function. The theme
# registry is checked to determine which implementation to use, which may
# be a function or a template.
#
# If the implementation is a function, it is executed and its return value
# passed along.
#
# If the implementation is a template, the arguments are converted to a
# variables array. This array is then modified by the module implementing
# the hook, theme engine (if applicable) and the theme. The following
# functions may be used to modify the variables array. They are processed in
# this order when available:
#
# - template_preprocess(&variables)
#   This sets a default set of variables for all template implementations.
#
# - template_preprocess_HOOK(&variables)
#   This is the first preprocessor called specific to the hook; it should be
#   implemented by the module that registers it.
#
# - MODULE_preprocess(&variables)
#   This will be called for all templates; it should only be used if there
#   is a real need. It's purpose is similar to template_preprocess().
#
# - MODULE_preprocess_HOOK(&variables)
#   This is for modules that want to alter or provide extra variables for
#   theming hooks not registered to itself. For example, if a module named
#   "foo" wanted to alter the submitted variable for the hook "node" a
#   preprocess function of foo_preprocess_node() can be created to intercept
#   and alter the variable.
#
# - ENGINE_engine_preprocess(&variables)
#   This function should only be implemented by theme engines and exists
#   so that it can set necessary variables for all hooks.
#
# - ENGINE_engine_preprocess_HOOK(&variables)
#   This is the same as the previous function, but it is called for a single
#   theming hook.
#
# - ENGINE_preprocess(&variables)
#   This is meant to be used by themes that utilize a theme engine. It is
#   provided so that the preprocessor is not locked into a specific theme.
#   This makes it easy to share and transport code but theme authors must be
#   careful to prevent fatal re-declaration errors when using sub-themes that
#   have their own preprocessor named exactly the same as its base theme. In
#   the default theme engine (PHPTemplate), sub-themes will load their own
#   template.php file in addition to the one used for its parent theme. This
#   increases the risk for these errors. A good practice is to use the engine
#   name for the base theme and the theme name for the sub-themes to minimize
#   this possibility.
#
# - ENGINE_preprocess_HOOK(&variables)
#   The same applies from the previous function, but it is called for a
#   specific hook.
#
# - THEME_preprocess(&variables)
#   These functions are based upon the raw theme; they should primarily be
#   used by themes that do not use an engine or by sub-themes. It serves the
#   same purpose as ENGINE_preprocess().
#
# - THEME_preprocess_HOOK(&variables)
#   The same applies from the previous function, but it is called for a
#   specific hook.
#
# There are two special variables that these hooks can set:
#   'template_file' and 'template_files'. These will be merged together
#   to form a list of 'suggested' alternate template files to use, in
#   reverse order of priority. template_file will always be a higher
#   priority than items in template_files. theme() will then look for these
#   files, one at a time, and use the first one
#   that exists.
# @param hook
#   The name of the theme function to call. May be an array, in which
#   case the first hook that actually has an implementation registered
#   will be used. This can be used to choose 'fallback' theme implementations,
#   so that if the specific theme hook isn't implemented anywhere, a more
#   generic one will be used. This can allow themes to create specific theme
#   implementations for named objects.
# @param ...
#   Additional arguments to pass along to the theme function.
# @return
#   An HTML string that generates the themed output.

# @defgroup themeable Default theme implementations
# @{
# Functions and templates that present output to the user, and can be
# implemented by themes.
#
# Drupal's presentation layer is a pluggable system known as the theme
# layer. Each theme can take control over most of Drupal's output, and
# has complete control over the CSS.
#
# Inside Drupal, the theme layer is utilized by the use of the theme()
# function, which is passed the name of a component (the theme hook)
# and several arguments. For example, theme('table', header, rows);
# Additionally, the theme() function can take an array of theme
# hooks, which can be used to provide 'fallback' implementations to
# allow for more specific control of output. For example, the function:
# theme(array('table__foo', 'table'), header, rows) would look to see if
# 'table__foo' is registered anywhere; if it is not, it would 'fall back'
# to the generic 'table' implementation. This can be used to attach specific
# theme functions to named objects, allowing the themer more control over
# specific types of output.
#
# As of Drupal 6, every theme hook is required to be registered by the
# module that owns it, so that Drupal can tell what to do with it and
# to make it simple for themes to identify and override the behavior
# for these calls.
#
# The theme hooks are registered via hook_theme(), which returns an
# array of arrays with information about the hook. It describes the
# arguments the function or template will need, and provides
# defaults for the template in case they are not filled in. If the default
# implementation is a function, by convention it is named theme_HOOK().
#
# Each module should provide a default implementation for themes that
# it registers. This implementation may be either a function or a template;
# if it is a function it must be specified via hook_theme(). By convention,
# default implementations of theme hooks are named theme_HOOK. Default
# template implementations are stored in the module directory.
#
# Drupal's default template renderer is a simple PHP parsing engine that
# includes the template and stores the output. Drupal's theme engines
# can provide alternate template engines, such as XTemplate, Smarty and
# PHPTal. The most common template engine is PHPTemplate (included with
# Drupal and implemented in phptemplate.engine, which uses Drupal's default
# template renderer.
#
# In order to create theme-specific implementations of these hooks,
# themes can implement their own version of theme hooks, either as functions
# or templates. These implementations will be used instead of the default
# implementation. If using a pure .theme without an engine, the .theme is
# required to implement its own version of hook_theme() to tell Drupal what
# it is implementing; themes utilizing an engine will have their well-named
# theming functions automatically registered for them. While this can vary
# based upon the theme engine, the standard set by phptemplate is that theme
# functions should be named either phptemplate_HOOK or THEMENAME_HOOK. For
# example, for Drupal's default theme (Garland) to implement the 'table' hook,
# the phptemplate.engine would find phptemplate_table() or garland_table().
# The ENGINE_HOOK() syntax is preferred, as this can be used by sub-themes
# (which are themes that share code but use different stylesheets).
#
# The theme system is described and defined in theme.inc.
